# go-mtmc

Yeah "stealing" the MSU MTMC - MonTana state Mini Computer. 
The idea is to make a clone in Go so a student can download a released version of the binary for their OS with as little setup as possible.
Mostly trying out vibe coding with this because Go doesn't have too many missing features from Java (if you squint) and with a well defined spec I thought it would be "easy" enough.
